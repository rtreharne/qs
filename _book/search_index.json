[["boss-fight.html", "10 Boss Fight", " 10 Boss Fight If you are currently participating in a timetabled BIOS103 QS workshop, please ensure that you complete this week’s formative and summative assessments in the BIOS103 Canvas Course. Wow. You’ve made it to the end of the BIOS103 QS course! Congratulations. Over the semester, you’ve built an impressive toolbox of skills. By now, you should be able to: Import data files in Excel and R. Clean, subset, and filter data in Excel and R. Generate tables of summary statistics in Excel and R. Perform a one-way ANOVA in Excel and R, and interpret the results. Conduct post-hoc tests using Bonferroni-corrected t-tests in Excel. Perform post-hoc tests using Tukey’s HSD in R. Conduct linear regression in Excel and R, and interpret the results. Generate boxplots, scatterplots, and histograms in Excel and R. Perform a two-way ANOVA in R. Conduct multiple linear regression (MLR) in R. Use pre-existing R code to parse FASTA files and perform basic bioinformatics on DNA sequences. Leverage R code and packages to perform automated image analysis on multiple files. Phew! When you put it all together, that’s an incredible skill set. But it’s not over just yet. Are you ready for one last challenge? Enter the Boss Fight: Four questions to test your mettle. Three have been adapted from the past four weeks (don’t worry, no yeast or mushrooms this time!). The final question is a fun one to wrap things up. This time, I’m not giving you any pre-written code. You’ll need to recycle and tweak what you’ve already encountered in Chapters 6, 8, and 9. Go attempt the final formative/summative assignments on Canvas now. And here’s your final learning objective: Learn that it’s OK to forget everything when it comes to code. Coding isn’t about memorising everything, it’s about knowing where to look and how to apply what you find. I’ve been coding for over a decade, and I still Google solutions regularly. The important thing is that you are now equipped with the tools and confidence to dive back into R next September, ready to tackle advanced quantitative skills with a solid foundation. A massive thank you to everyone who submitted feedback via the Likerty Split tool throughout the course. Your real-time ratings and comments have been instrumental in shaping and refining this course on the go. This is your final opportunity to share any feedback. Remember, it’s anonymous, so feel free to say what you think. Constructive criticism is always encouraged, and positive feedback is greatly appreciated. You can also view the feedback submitted by your peers here. As always, the demonstrator team will provide direct support in the Workshop channel on Microsoft Teams for this last formative and summative quiz. For those attending in person, I’ll be bringing a limited stock of mince pies to the Thursday 9–11 AM workshop session in the Randall Building. You’re all warmly invited to join us. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! Rob Treharne. 11/12/2024 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
