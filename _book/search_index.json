[["feedback.html", "Appendix II: Feedback", " Appendix II: Feedback I’m experimenting this year with “micro-feedback”. Rather than wait for you to complete (or not to complete in most cases) your end of module evaluation surveys I’m asking you to regularly rate your satisfaction with this course and provide additional comments. This will help me gain a deeper understanding how how your are interacting with the course content and to identify/fix any problems as they arise. I’ll update figure below as we go through the course. You can submit your feedback at any point here. Thanks for the feedback!
